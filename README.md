# This is my first application for ruby on rails. Just trying to test some stuff out and see what this stuff can do. 


# I'm not too sure what this will end up looking like, but hopefully it will be pretty nice. Some type of a picture blog or something.... I'll  call it "Wishlish" 


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
